## Introduction

flod is an R package for statistical learning on flow cytometry data in
R. Its primary concern is getting your data as fast as possible into R’s
rich ecosystem for modeling; which way you chose is then up to you but
it was developed with [tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/) in mind.

Additionally, flod also provides a few convenience functions for feature
engineering, visualizing, and reporting based on domain knowledge of
traditional flow cytometry analysis (e.g. using FlowJo).
